## Motivation

This cv was originally structured and built by [Debarghya Das](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume). So, please do check out his his repo. I altered the structure and the font styles a bit to better suit my needs.

And finally, to quote his own words,

> Common LaTeX resume-builders such as **moderncv** and the **friggeri-cv** look great if you're looking for a multi-page resume with numerous citations, but usually imperfect for making a thorough, single-page one. A lot of companies today search resumes based on keywords but at the same time require/prefer a one-page resume, especially for undergraduates.

## Dependencies

1. Compiles only with **XeTeX** and required **BibTex** for compiling publications and the .bib filetype.
2. Uses fonts that are usually only available to **Mac** users such as Helvetica Neue Light.
